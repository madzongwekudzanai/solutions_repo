Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion follows Newton\u2019s laws of motion. We analyze the motion by separating it into horizontal and vertical components. 1.1 Equations of Motion The motion of a projectile launched with initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) is governed by: Horizontal motion (constant velocity) x=v\u2080cos(\u03b8)t Vertical motion (accelerated due to gravity) [ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] Time of flight (when \\( y = 0 \\) ) [ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} ] Range of projectile [ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} ] Maximum height [ H = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{2g} ] 1.2 Effects of Air Resistance Without air resistance, projectiles follow a parabolic trajectory . However, with air resistance, the motion is more complex because drag opposes velocity. The drag force is given by: \\[ F_d = \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A v^2 \\] where: \\( C_d \\) = drag coefficient (depends on object shape) \\( \\rho \\) = air density (kg/m\u00b3) \\( A \\) = cross-sectional area (m\u00b2) \\( v \\) = velocity (m/s) The equations of motion then become nonlinear differential equations , which we solve numerically. 2.
